# Maths
Adding the integer math operators `+` `-` `*` `/` `%` and parenthesis for grouping. 

This relies on a special feature of ANTLR: implicit specification of operator precedence.
The book _The_Definitive_ANTLR_4_Reference_ describes this feature in section 5.4 "Dealing
with Precedence, left Recursion, and Associativity" starting on page 71.
